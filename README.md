# Set of useful middlewares for [grammY](https://grammy.dev/)

Feel free to contribute your middlewares to this repository.

## Installation

`yarn add grammy-middlewares`, duh.

## Usage

All the middleware accessors are factories, even though not all of them have to be. I decided to make API homogeneous.

Some of the factories consume optional or required parameters.

```typescript
import {
  ignoreOld,
  onlyAdmin,
  onlyPublic,
  onlySuperAdmin,
  sequentialize,
} from 'grammy-middlewares'

<...>

bot.use(
  ignoreOld(),
  onlyAdmin(ctx => ctx.reply(
    'Only admins can do this'
  )),
  onlyPublic(ctx => ctx.reply(
    'You can only use public chats'
  )),
  onlySuperAdmin(env.SUPER_ADMIN_ID),
  sequentialize()
)

<...>

menu.text(
  'Only menu creator',
  onlyMenuAuthor(ctx =>
    ctx.reply('Only menu creator can do this')
  ),
  ctx => ...
)
```

## Middlewares

### `ignoreOld`

Ignores old updates, useful when bot has been down for a while. You can optionaly specify the timeout in seconds which defaults to `5 * 60`.

### `onlyAdmin`

Checks if the user is an admin. You can optionally specify `errorHandler` that is called with the context if the user is not an admin.

### `onlyPublic`

Checks if it is a group chat or a channel. You can optionally specify `errorHandler` that is called with the context if it is not a group chat or a channel.

### `onlySuperAdmin`

Checks if the user is a super admin. You have to provide the super admin id.

### `sequentialize`

The basic [sequentialize](https://grammy.dev/advanced/scaling.html#concurrency-is-hard) middleware that takes the chat id as a sequential identifier.

### `onlyMenuAuthor`

[@grammyjs/menu](https://github.com/grammyjs/menu) middleware that checks if the user sending the callback is the menu author. To use it the menu has to reply to the menu caller.

## Development
